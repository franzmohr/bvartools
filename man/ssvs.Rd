\title{Stochastic Search Variable Selection}
\usage{
ssvs(a, tau0, tau1, prob_prior, include = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{an M-dimensional vector of coefficient draws.}

\item{tau0}{an M-dimensional vector of prior standard deviations for restricted variables.}

\item{tau1}{an M-dimensional vector of prior standard deviations for unrestricted variables.}

\item{prob_prior}{an M-dimensional vector of prior inclusion probabilites.}

\item{include}{an integer vector specifying the positions of variables, which should be
included in the SSVS algorithm. If \code{NULL} (default), SSVS will be applied to all variables.}
}
\value{
A named list containing two components:
\item{V_i}{an \eqn{M \times M} inverse prior covariance matrix.}
\item{lambda}{an M-dimensional vector of inclusion parameters.}
}
\description{
\code{ssvs} employs stochastic search variable selection as proposed by George et al. (2008)
to produce a draw of the precision matrix of the coefficients in a VAR model.
}
\details{
The function employs stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) as proposed
by George et al. (2008) to produce a draw of the diagonal inverse prior covariance matrix
\eqn{\underline{V}^{-1}} and the corresponding vector of inclusion parameters \eqn{\lambda}
of the vectorised coefficient matrix \eqn{a = vec(A)} for the VAR model
\deqn{y_t = A x_t + u_t,}
where \eqn{y_{t}} is a K-dimensional vector of endogenous variables,
\eqn{x_{t}} is a vector of explanatory variabes
and the error term is \eqn{u_t \sim \Sigma}.
